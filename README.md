## Build and Run

Follow the instructions to add and register a Linux self-hosted runner in GitHub Actions
Commit a code change to the GitHub repo to trigger the GitHub Action
The self-hosted runner should execute and deploy your code change in AWS
* Add instructions/details about allowing AWS to access the GitHub repo
```
